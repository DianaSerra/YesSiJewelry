# YesSiJewelry Front End - custom Jewelry Store Management App

YesSiJewelry is a custom Jewelry Store Management App designed and developed by Diana Serra.
It was created specifically for a client who sells and resells Jewelry through social media/Marketplace and
finds existing Inventory Management Apps to be cluttered and hard to use. The aim was to create one place
where the client could input new jewelry pieces, link any corresponding social media posts, and search their
existing pieces with ease.
